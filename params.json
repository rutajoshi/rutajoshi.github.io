{"name":"Hello world! My name is Ruta.","tagline":"About me and my adventures.","body":"### A bit about me\r\nI'm a first year Computer Science major at UC Berkeley, also studying Data Science. I've worked on research in clean technologies to reduce nitrate pollution and water contamination, and I got started in the tech industry by interning at [Codenvy](codenvy.com) and [StrollerHikes](strollerhikes.com). I'm currently studying Discrete Math & Probability and Data Structures, and I'm looking forward to making a few cool new projects of my own.\r\n\r\n[Download Resume](rutajoshi.github.io/docs/resume_jan2016.pdf)  \r\n\r\n#### Education\r\n**UC Berkeley**  \r\nMajor: Computer Science\r\nClass of 2019  \r\n\r\n##### Course Work Favorites\r\n######Fall 2015\r\n* Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (CS61A) - Python, Scheme, SQL\r\n* Foundations of Data Science (DS8/CS94/STAT94) - Python (ipynb)\r\n* Data Science and the Mind (L&S 39F)\r\n\r\n######Spring 2016\r\n* Data Structures (CS61B) - Java\r\n* Discrete Mathematics and Probability (CS70)\r\n\r\n#### Work Experience  \r\n#####[Codenvy](codenvy.com)  \r\n**Skills Practiced**: Marketing, collaboration, teamwork, market research\u000B  \r\n**Duration**: 6/2015 - 8/2015   \r\n**Notes**: Led a project to create a market map of containers and how they disrupt DevOps.
